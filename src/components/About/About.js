            <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a first-year university student pursuing software engineering and computer science. My project, Myndful, a mental health chatbot utilizing machine learning to support high school students, showcases my knack for innovation. Proficient across programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Lua, Java, and C#, I enjoy imparting my coding skills onto others.
<br></br><br></br>
In addition, I possess social media prowess, having successfully grown engaged networks on platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. I actively seek out collaborative opportunities with peers and professors alike to enrich academic research and lab participation for students. With over three years of industry exposure under my belt, I now strive to join dynamic teams and take on projects that will both challenge me and foster my professional development.</p>
